# Introduction

Tether is the first **Universal Non-Custodial Payment Gateway** designed specifically for AI agents. 

Traditional payment systems were built for humans. They rely on manual approvals, static budgets, and centralized custody. Tether changes this by introducing a **Hardware-Enforced Intent Layer** that bridges your secure treasury to the agentic economy.

## Why Tether?

*   **Non-Custodial:** Your capital stays in your bank. Your keys are locked in hardware. Tether never has discretionary power over your funds.
*   **Intent-Aware:** We don't just check the price; we check the "Why." Tether validates transactions against the agent's real-time task logs inside a TEE.
*   **Universal Support:** Works with over 150 million merchants globally out of the box. No new "Agent Protocols" required.

## The Core Concept: JIT Funding

Tether uses **Just-In-Time (JIT) Funding**. This means your Tether Virtual Card maintains a **$0 balance** by default. When a transaction is attempted, our engine validates the agent's intent and policy in milliseconds. Only if verified, the exact amount is pulled from your treasury to fund the card for that single transaction.
